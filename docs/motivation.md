## Motivation :blue_book:

Mainly in modern applications, developers are facing problems to store data. Currently the community is using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html), [overmind](https://overmindjs.org/), etc for this purpose. **As web-based applications are natively event-based, it'll be nice
to have an event-based store for the data**. This library is an implementation of event-based data storage inspired by [Event store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_store) :bulb:.
It is called to create an in-memory event sourcing storage.
