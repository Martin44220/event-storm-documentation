Generally saying **subscription** is receiving some information(maybe something) over some agreement. According to the definition the act of subscription is based on particular subscription subject. Which basically means, that the owner of the subscription must receive an information, if and only if, the particular subject has been changed. Furthermore, the owner of the subject must not be even "disturbed", for any other reason.

Coming to the computer sceince. In CS the above can be described as a regular situation between observer and consumer on observable subject. Either it can be the event, subcriber and subscription.
