In contrast to having this, the composition and deriving the real information is suggested. The Event Storm library suggests for this purpose usage of virtual models. On the other hand, it\'s straightforward, that at scale this will result in a lot of boilerplate code. That\u2019s why the library is suggesting a store concept which has the full power of decentralized data store.","permalink":"/event-storm-documentation/docs/api-reference/storm"},{"id":"concepts/subscription","title":"What is a subscription?","description":"Generally saying subscription is receiving some information(maybe something) over some agreement.
